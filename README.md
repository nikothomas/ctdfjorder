## ⭐ Features
- Read RBR (.rsk) and SonTek Castaway (.csv) files and extract CTD data
- Process CTD data, including removing non-positive samples and cleaning data
- Calculate derived quantities such as absolute salinity, density, and potential density
- Determine mixed layer depth (MLD) using different methods
- Generate plots for visualizing CTD profiles and derived quantities
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy processing and merging of CTD data files

## 📦 Installation
It's recommended that you create a new environment just for CTDFjorder. This can be done in conda with the following
command.
```shell
conda create --name ctdfjorder python=3.12
conda activate ctdfjorder
```
To install ctdfjorder you can use pip:
```shell
pip install ctdfjorder
```

## 🚀 Usage
CTDFjorder provides a command-line interface (CLI) for processing and analyzing CTD data in addition to serving
as a python library. A tutorial has been setup [here](https://nikothomas.github.io/ctdfjorder/Getting%20Started.html)
for running the CLI.
